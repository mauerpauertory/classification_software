# classification_software

The main execution files are:
-Classify_Dataset_I.py
-Classify_Dataset_II.py
-Classify_Dataset_III.py

The classification-related logic (cross-validation, algorithms fitting and predictions, evaluation metrics) are inside ClassificationAlgorithms.py

Preprocessing methods for all 3 scenarios are inside PreprocessingPhase.py

The execution bat file run_scenarios.bat is for running the main execution files one after another 

Other files are just drafts for testing or using methods for examples within my thesis
